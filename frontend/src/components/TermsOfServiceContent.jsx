        <p className="font-semibold text-[#111827] mb-2">This is the most important section of these Terms.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          PoultraScan AI uses artificial intelligence to analyze images of poultry and generate
          estimates related to disease indicators, weight, oil yield, and market readiness. These
          results are automated estimates only and:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-1 mb-2">
          <li>Are <strong>not</strong> a substitute for examination, diagnosis, or treatment by a licensed veterinarian or qualified poultry health professional</li>
          <li>May be inaccurate, incomplete, or wrong, particularly in cases involving atypical lighting, image quality, flock density, or breed variation</li>
          <li>Should not be the sole basis for decisions involving flock culling, medical treatment, quarantine, or market sale, especially for sick, high-value, or large-scale commercial flocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a scan indicates signs of illness or abnormality, you should confirm findings with a
          licensed veterinarian before taking action. You assume full responsibility for decisions
          made based on Service output, and we are not liable for losses (financial, agricultural,
          or otherwise) resulting from reliance on AI-generated results.

        <h3 className="text-sm font-bold text-[#111827] mb-1">7. Data Storage and Farm/Account Scoping</h3>
        <p>
          Scan results, images, and cached data are associated with your specific user account and
          the farm you select at the time of scanning. Deleting a farm or account may result in
          permanent loss of associated scan history, images, and journal entries. We recommend
          exporting or backing up important records before deleting a farm.
